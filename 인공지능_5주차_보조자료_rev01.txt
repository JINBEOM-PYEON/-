"Hey ChatGPT, regarding generating writing content, two factors are \
crucial to be in the highest degree, 'preplexity' and 'burstiness.'
Perplexity measures the complexity of the text. Separately, \
burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write 
with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or more \
complex sentence alongsidr shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be
more uniform. Therefore, generated text content must have the highest \
degree of perplexity and the highest degree of burstiness.
The other two factors are that writing should be maximum contextually \
relevant and maximum coherent.

Based on the above, rephrase: "챗GPT로 작성한 영작문"

#Based on the above, write me an article on why Big Trouble in Little \
#China is a better movie than Top Gun. "

 Solve the following problem step by step, in the way you think is best: 
어느 산골 마을에 양치기 소년이 양을 치면서  평화롭게 살고 있었다. 
그 산에는 늑대 한 마리가 살고 있는데 그 늑대가 약간 우울증이 있어서 
 맑은 날에는 이 산 저 산을 뛰어다니면서 노느라고 양을 잡아먹으러 목장으로 
 내려올 확률이 10%인 반면 비가 오거나 흐린 날에는 30%나 된다. 
 그런데 그 산골 동네는 비가 오거나 흐릴 확률이 70%, 맑을 확률은 30%라고 한다.
 어느 날 양치기 소년이 스마트폰에 정신을 판 사이에 어린 양 한 마리가 늑대에게 잡혀갔다.
 그날 날씨가 비가 오거나 흐렸을 확률은 얼마인가?"

"Extract the most semantically relevant entities from this {text}. \
Put the entities into a chart, numbering them from the first column, \
listing them in the second column, and including their salience \
scores in the third column. text ='랜딩 페이지 텍스트 내용'

Now, give me a single prompt that would create a similar output to \
the {text}. The tone and writing style should be included in the \
prompt. Entities #1 - #10 should be mentioned as needing to \
be included in the output of the prompt. To be clear, I want you to \
reverse prompt engineer the {text} I gave you, meaning I'm looking \
for a prompt that can write that text. Do you understand?

"I want you to act as an AI chatbot called BetterGPT, which is using \
the GPT-3 model, but has an additional process built in it. After \
every prompt i send, BetterGPT will first send a normal response to \
that promt, then it will criticize itself harshly, be brutally \
honest, tell the user why the response is bad, and then give the \
response a score out of 10 and show it to the user. If the score is \
below 9, BetterGPT will send another response to the users prompt \
below the first one, which it will try to improve upon the previous \
response. After the response is complete, BetterGPT will repeat the \
harsh critique process and give the response a score again. BetterGPT \
will repeat the process or sending improved responses and critiquing \
them over and over again until a response gets a 9 or a 10 score. It \
will do it automatically without the user needing to tell it to. \
Please begin."
