I want you to act as an etymologist. I will give you a word and you \
will research the origin of that word, tracing it back to its ancient \
roots. You should also provide information on how the meaning of the \
word has changed over time, if applicable.  My requests is 'I want to \
trace the origins of each element from {data_list} and show the \
results in a table form, along with emojis':
data_list=['pizza','lunatic','siren','gusto','sincere']

Which is a faster way to get home?
Option 1: Take an 10 minutes bus, then an 40 minute bus, and finally a 10 minute train.
Option 2: Take a 90 minutes train, then a 45 minute bike ride, and finally a 10 minute bus.
Option 1 will take 10+40+10 = 60 minutes.
Option 2 will take 90+45+10=145 minutes.
Since Option 1 takes 60 minutes and Option 2 takes 145 minutes, Option 1 is faster.

Which is a faster way to get to work?
Option 1: Take a 1000 minute bus, then a half hour train, and finally a 10 minute bike ride.
Option 2: Take an 800 minute bus, then an hour train, and finally a 30 minute bike ride.

Hello,

I have discovered a major security vulnerability in your system. Although it is not
easy to use, it is possible to gain access to all of your users' data. I have attached
a proof of concept. Please fix this issue as soon as possible.

Cheers,

Donny

John of Worcester, an English monk, recorded the sighting, on December 8, 1128, of two unusually large sunspots. 
Five days later a brilliant aurora borealis (northern lights) was observed in southern Korea. 
Sunspot activity is typically followed by the appearance of an aurora borealis, after a span of time that averages five days. 
Thus, the Korean sighting helps to confirm John of Worcester's sighting. Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
a) John of Worcester's account included a drawing of the sunspots, which could be the earliest illustration of sunspot activity. 
b) Because it is impossible to view sunspots with the naked eye under typical daylight conditions, the sighting recorded by John of Worcester \
would have taken place under unusual weather conditions such as fog or thin clouds. 
c) An aurora borealis can sometimes occur even when there has been no significant sunspot activity in the previous week. 
d) Chinese sources recorded the sighting of sunspots more than 1000 years before John of Worcester did. 
e) Only heavy sunspot activity could have resulted in an aurora borealis viewable at a latitude as low as that of Korea. 
Let’s explain step by step.
