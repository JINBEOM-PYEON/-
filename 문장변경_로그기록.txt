Generate a table of 10 different suggestions of improvements that \
could be related to the {text} with numbers in the left column of the \
table for me to pick from. After the table, ask the question "What \
improvements would you like to make to the {text}? Pick one from the \
table above" below the table. Acknowledge with "..." if you \
understand the task, don't create a table yet.

text = The Matrix trilogy suggests that everyone has the individual \
responsibility to make the choice between the real world and an \
artificial world. Though Neo is the exemplar of free will, fate plays \
a large role in his adventure. Neo relies on the Oracle, and \
everything she says comes true in some way. Also add a log of the \
change column.
